Mandatory Blocks

The Array#bsearch method is used to search ordered Arrays more quickly
than #find and #select can. Assume you have the following code:

a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]

How would you search this Array to find the first element whose value
exceeds 8?

Doc for Array #bsearch is found at:
https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html#method-i-bsearch

a.bsearch {|x| x > 8} #=> 11
