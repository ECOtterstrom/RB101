Down the Rabbit Hole
Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

I found documentation for ::load_file at:
https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.1/libdoc/psych/rdoc/
Psych.html#method-c-load_file

It was under Psych because the underlying implementation of YAML is the 
libyaml wrapper Psych.
