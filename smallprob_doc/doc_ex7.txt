Parent Class

Use irb to run the following code:

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect


You should find that it prints a list of all of the public methods
available to the String s; this includes not only those methods
defined in the String class, but also methods that are inherited
from Object (which inherits other methods from the BasicObject class
and the Kernel module). That's a lot of methods.

How would you modify this code to print just the public methods that
are defined or overridden by the String class? That is, the list
should exclude all members that are only defined in Object, 
BasicObject, and Kernel.

Documentation for public_methods found at:

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods(all=false).inspect
